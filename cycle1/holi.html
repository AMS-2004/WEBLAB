<h1>HOLI:A JOYFUL AND COLORFUL FESTIVAL</h1>
<img src="holoi.jpeg"alt="Holi"style="width:500px;height:700px;">
<p>Holi is the Hindu "Festival of Colours," a vibrant, joyful celebration marking the arrival of spring and signifying the victory of good over evil. It involves a night of Holika Dahan (bonfires) and a day of playing with coloured powders and water. Rooted in mythology, particularly the story of Prahlad and Holika, and the legend of Krishna and Radha, Holi also represents love, unity, and new beginnings.
