A flower is the brightly colored, often fragrant reproductive part of a flowering plant, characterized by parts like sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, which are responsible for attracting pollinators and producing seeds for new plants. Flowers come in a vast array of shapes, sizes, and colors, serving a vital role in the life cycle of angiosperms and often cultivated for their aesthetic qualities.
