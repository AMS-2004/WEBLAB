<img src="diwali.jpeg"alt="Diwali"style="width:500px;height:700px;">
<p>Diwali, or Deepavali, is a vibrant five-day "Festival of Lights" celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and some Buddhists, symbolizing the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. Originating from ancient India, the festival involves lighting oil lamps, decorating homes with colourful patterns called rangoli, exchanging gifts and sweets, and feasting. The specific traditions and stories vary by faith and region, but a common thread is the emphasis on family, community, prosperity, and the celebration of new beginnings.</p>
