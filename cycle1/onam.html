<p> Onam is an annual 10-day harvest festival celebrated by the Malayali community, primarily in the Indian state of Kerala, during the month of Chingam (Augustâ€“September). It commemorates the legendary King Mahabali's annual return to his prosperous kingdom and honors the Vamana avatar of Lord Vishnu. Celebrations feature vibrant pookalam (flower carpets), a grand feast called Onasadya, traditional dances, Vallam Kali (boat races), and cultural performances. </p>
