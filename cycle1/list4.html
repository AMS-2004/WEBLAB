A tree is a tall, long-lived, woody plant characterized by a single main stem or trunk, supporting branches, and a root system that anchors it and absorbs water and nutrients from the soil. Essential to life, trees provide habitats and food for wildlife, produce oxygen, and supply materials for building, furniture, paper, and medicine. Their major parts are the roots, trunk, and leaves, which work together to sustain growth and provide vital ecological functions.
