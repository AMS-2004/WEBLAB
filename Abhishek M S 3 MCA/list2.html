A vegetable is the edible part of a plant, which can be a leaf, stem, root, flower, or seed, and is typically eaten as part of a savory dish. While some botanical fruits like tomatoes are considered vegetables in a culinary sense, true vegetables are usually savory and lack seeds, though exceptions exist. Vegetables are a vital part of a healthy diet, providing essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
